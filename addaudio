Hey guys
Whenever I try to add an audio file to my project, it just freezes up. The mouse has this little arrow on it. I created 3 projects before this one and had no issues. I'm doing the exact same thing this time as well.

I've made a loom video showing exactly what happens:

Has this happened with anyone? What to do? The audio files aren't large. One is 20 minutes and the other is one hour, but even when I only try to add the 20 min one, it freezes on this particular project.
